Platform Overview:
"Website as a Gift" is a creative platform that enables anyone to design and gift personalized, interactive websites for special occasions. It transforms the traditional greeting card into an immersive digital experience, allowing users to build sentimental pages complete with an animated "gift box" reveal, background music, heartfelt letters, and photo galleries. It is the perfect modern solution for birthdays, anniversaries, and celebrations where a physical gift might feel too ordinary.

The platform offers an intuitive, no-code creation flow where users can mix and match beautiful templates (such as Welcome Heroes, Letters, and Trivia), customize color themes, and even use AI to polish their messages. By combining ease of use with premium aesthetics, it empowers users to create lasting digital keepsakes that recipients can cherish forever, all accessible via a simple shareable link.
