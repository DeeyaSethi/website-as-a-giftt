🧠 Project Idea: “Website as a Gift”

I want to build a platform called “Website as a Gift” — where anyone can easily create a small, personalized website as a digital gift.
Examples: a birthday website, anniversary website, newborn announcement, or friendship page.

⸻

🎯 Vision

The experience should feel magical — a user gives some details about the person or event, and an AI automatically generates a beautiful, hosted website as a heartfelt gift.

⸻

🧩 Core Flow
	1.	User answers questions or provides a short prompt (e.g. “Make a birthday website for my best friend Ananya who loves cats and travel”).
	2.	AI determines:
	•	The theme (Birthday / Anniversary / Newborn / Friendship / etc.)
	•	The page layout (Gallery, Messages, Timeline, About, etc.)
	3.	AI generates personalized text and captions for each page.
	4.	The system stitches together pre-built page components into a React-based site.
	5.	The site is auto-deployed on GitHub Pages or Vercel.
	6.	Optionally, the user can purchase a custom domain via an API integration.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend + Backend
	•	Next.js 15 (App Router) → for full-stack rendering + static export
	•	React + TypeScript → ensures maintainable, scalable components
	•	Tailwind CSS → modern, fast styling
	•	shadcn/ui (or DaisyUI) → consistent, polished UI components

AI Integration
	•	Claude 3.5 Sonnet or OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
	•	Use AI for:
	•	Selecting the most fitting theme
	•	Deciding which page templates to use
	•	Generating text, tone, and captions

Hosting & Deployment
	•	Vercel (for live preview and deployment)
	•	GitHub Pages (for free hosting)
	•	Optional: Namecheap API / GoDaddy API (for domain purchases)

🧱 Architecture Overview
User Input → Theme Selector → AI Engine → Template Composer → Deployer
1️⃣ Input Layer

Collects traits, relationship, tone, occasion, etc.

2️⃣ Theme Selector

AI (or rules engine) classifies input into a theme like Birthday, Anniversary, etc.

3️⃣ AI Engine

Decides:
	•	Which page components to include (Gallery, Letter, Messages, Timeline)
	•	The order of those pages
	•	The content tone and generated copy

4️⃣ Template Composer

A modular system of React components:Each template follows a common interface so that pages can be dynamically assembled.
Each template follows a common interface so that pages can be dynamically assembled.

5️⃣ Deployer

Exports the project using next export and deploys it:
	•	GitHub Pages (via GitHub API)
	•	or Vercel (via Deployment API)

🧩 Folder Structure (suggested)
/website-as-a-gift
 ┣ /app
 ┃ ┣ /api
 ┃ ┃ ┣ generate-site.ts       ← generates site from AI + templates
 ┃ ┃ ┗ deploy.ts              ← handles deployment
 ┃ ┣ /[theme]
 ┃ ┃ ┣ /components            ← reusable page templates per theme
 ┃ ┃ ┗ /layout.tsx
 ┣ /lib
 ┃ ┣ ai.ts                    ← AI logic (theme + content generation)
 ┃ ┣ templates.ts             ← registry of available templates
 ┃ ┣ deploy.ts                ← deployment handler
 ┃ ┗ utils.ts                 ← helper functions
 ┣ /data                      ← static assets, theme metadata
 ┣ /public                    ← images, icons, assets
 ┣ package.json
 ┗ tailwind.config.js

 🧩 Key Design Principles
	1.	Extensible Architecture:
	•	Each page type (Gallery, Letter, Timeline, etc.) is a pluggable React component following a shared interface.
	•	Adding a new page type or theme should require zero changes to the core logic.
	2.	Scalable AI Layer:
	•	AI logic separated from templates (in /lib/ai.ts)
	•	Easy to swap models or add fallback logic.
	3.	Clean Code Structure:
	•	Feature-based folders
	•	Strong TypeScript typings
	•	Config-driven theme and page registry (to easily extend)
	4.	Composable and Reusable Components:
	•	Each UI block is standalone and shareable across themes.
	5.	Simple Deployment Abstraction:
	•	The deployment logic (/lib/deploy.ts) is modular, allowing new destinations like Cloudflare Pages or Netlify later.

🚀 MVP Goals

✅ Input form → user enters prompt or answers
✅ AI selects pages + generates text
✅ Previews generated site
✅ Deploys to Vercel or GitHub Pages with one click

⸻

🧩 Future Extensions
	•	Add premium templates and paid domains
	•	Add photo/video upload and AI captioning
	•	Add analytics dashboard (views, shares, etc.)
	•	Add printable “poster as a gift” option
	•	Add gift customization (color palette, tone, music background)

💡 Focus for Cursor AI

Focus on building a clean, modular, and extendible architecture from the start —
something that can scale easily as new features (like posters, digital cards, or e-gift pages) are added.
Use strong TypeScript interfaces, clean file organization, and abstraction boundaries (AI, Template, Deployment layers).
